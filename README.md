# Analysis White Wine Quality - Tableau Desktop and Tableau Pre Builder
Group Project: Rayna Liu, Zhuoya Li

## Background and Introduction
Wine is playing an increasingly important role in food culture. Both red and white wines are favored by the public. The primary reason is wine enhances the flavors of the food, especially when you have a wonderful marriage of food and high-quality wine. For example, the crispness in white wines brings out the light, delicate flavors of fish, pork, and chicken *(Ron Saikowski, 2016)*. Since, selecting different quality wine to pair with food will make or break the flavor combination, distinguishing and understanding the quality of wine is useful. Also, distinguishing and understanding the quality of wine is important to winemaking, wine collectors, and sellers, who are keener to get high-quality wines.

Wine quality, as Maynard Amerine, a pioneering researcher in the cultivation, fermentation, and sensory evaluation of wine once said, is easier to detect than define *(Jackson, 2017)*. Since defining the wine quality is a matter of perception and itâ€™s subjective, detect wine quality in terms of its chemistry will be more well-founded.

## Objectives and Goals
In this project, we will do research on different characteristics in the white wine such as alcohol, chlorides, citric acid, density, etc. to gain a better understanding on how each contributes to the quality. Our goal is to classify the quality of wine by detecting the content of chemical characteristics in wine for providing customers and sellers with white wine quality prediction and reference before tasting it.
